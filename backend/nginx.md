## INSTALLATION
### Install with a package manager
Quick and easy but doesn't allow to install any extra modules

__APT (Debian and Ubuntu)__

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
```
After installation with **apt-get**, Nginx starts running automatically.

Check the installation and started process
```shell
ps aux | grep nginx
```
Check configuraton files now stored in following directory
```shell
ls -l /etc/nginx
```

__YUM (Fedora and CentOS)__
```shell
yum install epel-release
yum install nginx
```
After installation with **yum**, Nginx doesn't run automatically. You need to start it as a service with following command.
```shell
service nginx start
```
<br/>

### Install by building from source and adding modules

Go to http://nginx.org/en/download.html, find Mainline version, copy the link and download the archive
```shell
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.15.3.tar.gz
```
Extract files from the archive and chage into extracted directory
```shell
tar -zxvf nginx-1.15.3.tar.gz &&
cd nginx-1.15.3
```
In order to compile our source code we need to install a compiler

__apt__
```shell
apt-get install build-essential
```
__yum__
```shell
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```
Install additinal required dependecies

__apt__
```shell
apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev 
```
__yum__
```shell
yum install pcre pcre-devel zlib zlib-devel openssl openssl-devel
```
Configure the source code for the build
```shell
./cofigure --sbin-path=/usr/bin/nginx --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log --with-pcre --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --with-http_ssl_module
```
See complete list of options for install modules here: http://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html

Compile configured source code and than install the compiled source
```shell
make && make install
```
Test installation by checking Nginx version
```shell
nginx -V
```
Now you can start Nginx by simply running
```shell
nginx
```
<br/>

### Configure a system service for Nginx
This will allow us to start, stop, restart, reload configuration and start Nginx on boot much simplier

Create and save following file as /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
```shell
[Unit]
Description=The NGINX HTTP and reverse proxy server
After=syslog.target network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/nginx -t
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nginx
ExecReload=/usr/bin/nginx -s reload
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now you can user **systemctl** to control Nginx
```shell
systemctl start nginx //start nginx
systemctl status nginx //check nginx status
systemctl stop nginx //stop nginx
systemctl enable nginx //make nginx always start on boot
```

<br/>

## CONFIGURATION

### Contexts and Directives

Two main Nginx configuration terms are **context** and **directive**;
- **Directives** are specific configuration options that get set in the configuration files and consist of __name__ and a __value__.
- **Context**, on the other hand, is a sections of a configuration where directives can be set for that given context. Essentially, __context__ is the same as scope. And like scope, contexts are also nested and inherit from their parents.

The main Nginx configuration file is /etc/nginx/__nginx.conf__
It may include configuration pieces from other .conf files by __```include```__ directive that takes a relative path to another .conf file as an argument. 

__Example:__
```nginx

events {}

http {

  include mime.types;

  server {

    listen 80; 
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;
  }
}

```

After altering the .conf file, you need to reload the server to changes take effect. To do it without downtime, use:
```shell
systemctl reload nginx
```

If your configuration is not workin as expected, verify the syntax by running:
```shell
nginx -t
```
<br/>

### Directive Types
__1. Array Directive__
Can be specified multiple times without overriding a previous setting. Gets inherited by all child contexts. Child context can override inheritance by re-declaring directive
  ```nginx
  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
  access_log /var/log/nginx/custom.log.gz custom_format;
  ```
__2. Standard Directive__
   Can only be declared once. A second declaration overrides the first one. Gets inherited by all child contexts. Child context can override inheritance by re-declaring directive.
  ```nginx
  root /sites/site2;
  ```

__3. Action Directive__
  Invokes an action such as a rewrite or redirect. Inheritance does not apply as the request is either stopped (redirect/response) or re-evaluated (rewrite). 
  ```nginx
  return 403 "You do not have permission to view this.";
  ```
<br/>
### Location Blocks
Location blocks define the server behavior on reqeusts to the specific URIs relative to the root directory.
```nginx
location = <URI> {
    /...handle response
}
```

There are four types of URI match patterns (in the order of preference):
__1. Exact match__  __```=```__ 
   ```nginx
   location = /greet {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location.';
    }
   ```
__2. Preferential prefix match__ __```^~```__
   ```nginx
   location ^~ /Greet2 {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location.';
    }
   ```
__3. RegEx match__
  - case sensitive __```~```__      
   ```nginx
    location ~ /greet[0-9] {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - REGEX MATCH.';
    }
   ```
  - case insensitive __```*~```__
   ```nginx
   location ~* /greet[0-9] {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - REGEX MATCH INSENSITIVE.';
    }
   ```
__4. Prerfix match__ (no modifier, just URI)

```nginx
location /greet {
    return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - PREFIX MATCH.';
}
```

__Example:__
  ```nginx

  http {

    include mime.types;

    server {

      listen 80;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;

      root /sites/demo;

      location ^~ /Greet2 {
        return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location.';
      }

      location ~* /greet[0-9] {
        return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - REGEX MATCH INSENSITIVE.';
      }
    }
  }
  ```
<br/>

### Variables

Nginx provodes a set of useful native variables. They all prefixed with a __$__ sign.
```$host```, ```$uri```, ```$args```,```$scheme```, ```$request_method```,```$request_uri```, etc.

Usage example: the response of _/inspect_ route will be a requested host, uri and arguments provided in the request query string.
  ```nginx
  location /inspect {
      return 200 "$host\n $uri\n $args";
  }
  ```
If our query string has two parameters __fname__ and __lname__, we can get its values individually:
  ```nginx
  location /inspect {
      return 200 "First Name: $arg_fname\n Last Name: $arg_lname";
  }
  ```
See the full list of Nginx native variables here: http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html

We can create our own variables with a special __```set```__ directive followed by variable name and its value (can be a string, an integer or boolean.
  ```nginx
  set $admin "Yes";
```
After the declaration we can use our new variable in the context it has been declared in and all child contexts.

<br/>

### Conditional Statements
Nginx config syntax supports basic conditional statements with __```if```__ directive.

```nginx
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    set $mon 'No';

    if ( $date_local = 'Monday' ) {
      set $mon 'Yes';
    }

    location /is_monday {

      return 200 $mon;
    }
  }
```
We can also use regular expressions in conditional statements with __~__ operator:
```nginx
if ( $date_local ~ 'Saturday|Sunday' ) {
      set $weekend 'Yes';
    }
```
Note that using conditional statemets inside the location blocks is higly discouraged, it can cause unexpected behavior. See the article: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/depth/ifisevil
<br/>

### Rewrites and Redirects

We can rewrite reqeusted URI and redirect the client to another URI by using __```rewrite```__ or __```return```__ directives. In case of using __```return```__ with the 3** status codes, instead of string as a second parameters, it accepts an URI which the client should be redirected to. Syntax:
```nginx
return 3** <URI>
rewrite <regex pattern> <URI>
```
Example with __return__:
```nginx
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    location /greet {
      return 307 /thumb.png;
    }
  }
```
Exaple with __rewrite__:
```nginx
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    rewrite ^/user/\w+ /greet

    location /greet {
      return 200 "Hello User!";
    }
  }
```
Note that in case of using __```return```__, the URI of your reqeust will be changed to one you have been redirected to. If you use __```rewrite```__ directive, your URI will remain the same and you will get the content of redirection destination page.

We can also use regular expression to capture and use individual parts of the request URI with __$__ sign. In the exapmle below, we captured provided parameter to redirect the client to the specified location:
```nginx
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    rewrite ^/user/(\w+) /greet/$1

    location /greet {
      return 200 "Hello User!";
    }

    location = /greet/john {
       return 200 "Hello John!" 
    }
  }
```

Another useful feature is the __last__ flag to not allow the URI to be rewritten after the first rewrite. In the exapmle below, the first rewrite statement will trigger the redirection to _/greet/john_, but will not be rewritten by the second statement, so _"Hello John"_ will be returned instead of _/thumb.png_.

```nginx
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    rewrite ^/user/(\w+) /greet/$1 last;
    rewrite ^/greet/john /thumb.png;

    location /greet {

      return 200 "Hello User";
    }

    location = /greet/john {
      return 200 "Hello John";
    }
  }
```

<br/>

### Try Files and Named Locations

__```try_files```__ directive can be used in __```server```__ context applying to all incoming requests or inside individual __```location```__ contexts. It allows us to have Nginx checking a resource to respond with in any number of locations relative to the root directive. 
Syntax:
```nginx
try_files <path 1> <path 2> final;
```
In the exapmle below, Nginx serves _thumb.png_ file if one existst relative to the root directory and redirects to _/greet_ loction in case when file not found. Remmember that you can use other location (not files) only as the last argument to have Nginx re-evaluate the reqeust and make it caugth by location block.
```nginx
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    try_files /thumb.png /greet;

    location /greet {
      return 200 "Hello User";
    }
  }
```
It is often when __```try_files```__ used with Nginx variables. For exapmple, we can check for original request URI first before checking for other locations;
```nginx
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    try_files $uri /thumb.png /greet;

    location /greet {
      return 200 "Hello User";
    }
  }
```
We can create default 404 location and set it as the last argument of __```try_files```__ to always show 404 page if any other resources haven't been found:
```nginx
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    try_files $uri /thumb.png /cat.jpeg /friendly_404;

    location /friendly_404 {
      return 404 "Sorry, this file could not be found.";
    }
  }
```
 Nginx allows us to name locations with __```@```__ prefix to, for example, use the name as the last argument of __```try_files```__. In the case of using named location, request doesn't get re-evaluated, it just calls directly.
 __Example:__
 ```nginx
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    try_files $uri /thumb.png /cat.jpeg @friendly_404;

    location @friendly_404 {
      return 404 "Sorry, this file could not be found.";
    }
  }
 ```

<br/>

### Logging

Nginx provides two log types: 
- __Error Log__ for anything that failed or didn't happen as expected.
- __Access Log__ for logging all requests to the server.

Logging is enabled by default and writes logs to two corresponding files: __/var/log/nginx/error.log__ and __/var/log/nginx/access.log__
Leaving default logging configuration will be enough for most cases, but sometimes we need to create custom log files or disable logging for specific context. We can do it with __```access_log```__ and __```error_log```__ directives.

Custom logging for specific context:
  ```nginx
  server {

      listen 80;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;

      root /sites/demo;

      location /secure {
        access_log /var/log/nginx/secure.access.log
        return 200 "Welcome to secure area.";
      }
    }
  ``` 
 Disable logging for a given context:

  ```nginx
  server {

      listen 80;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;

      root /sites/demo;

      location /secure {
        access_log off
        return 200 "Welcome to secure area.";
      }
    }
  ``` 
For more advances logging configuration, see this article: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging
<br/>

### Worker Processes
Nginx always has one __Master__ process and one or more __Worker__ processes. Master process is the actual Nginx service (or software instance) which we started. That master process than spawns worker processes which actually deal with client requests and corresponding responses.
The default number or worker processes is 1. To change this number, use __```worker_processes```__ directive in the main context.

  ```nginx
  worker_processes 2;

  events{}

  http {
    ...
  }
  ```
__NOTE:__ increasing the number of worker processes does not guarantee the increase of performance. By its asynchronous nature, Nginx will handle requests as fast as the hardware is capable of. Single Nginx worker process can run properly only on a single CPU core. If you try to run, for example, two worker processes on a single core, think of the result as each of the processes runs only on 50% of its capabilities. So there's no reason to spawn more processes than number of CPU cores of the actual machine. To check how many cores your processes has, run:
  ```shell
  nproc
  ```
or
  ```shell
  lscpu
  ```
But Nginx gives us a very simple way of automating this by setting __```worker_processes```__ direcetive argument to *__auto__*:
  ```nginx
  worker_processes auto;
  ```
Another related directive is __```worker_connections```__. It controls the number of connections the worker process can accept and declares in the __```events```__ context. It's better to set its value to the number of your machine's limit of number of files that can be opened at once (for each CPU core). To check this number, run:
  ```shell
  ulimit -n
  ```
Than set the value
  ```nginx
  events {

    worker_connections <NUMBER>
  }
  ```
Now you can find the maximum number of cuncurrent requests our server should be able to accept: __```worker_processes```__ x __```worker_connections```__ = max connections.

<br/>

### Buffers and Timeouts
To optimize Nginx processes, we can configure buffer sizes and timeouts. But we should do this only on purpose because default settings are already optimized for the general range of tasks.
- __Buffer__ is a layer of protection that allows us to use machine's memory effectively.
  Nginx buffering directives are declared in the __http__ context and are self-explainatory. 

  
  - __```client_body_buffer_size```__ – sets buffer size for the request body;
  - __```client_max_body_size```__ – sets max allowed size for the request body;
  - __```client_header_buffer_size```__ - sets a buffer size for request headers

  <br/>
  
  For the amount of memory that will be allocated for the buffer, Nginx supports following abbreviatins:
    - 100 (plain number) // bytes
    - 10K (or 10k) // kilobytes
    - 10M (or 10m) // megebytes

  __Example:__
    ```nginx
    http {

      ...
      client_body_buffer_size 10K;
      client_max_body_size 8m;
      client_header_buffer_size 1k;
      ...
    }
    ```

  We can configure Nginx to not use the buffer at all for specific cases (it will read data from the disk and write it directly to the response): 
  - __```sendfile```__ - enables/disables buffering for static files;
  - __```tcp_nopush```__ – optimizes sendfile packets size;

  __Example:__
    ```nginx
    http {
      
      ...
      sendfile on;
      tcp_nopush on;
      ...
    }
    ```

- __Timeouts__ set a cut-off time to a given event (request). It can, for example, prevent a client to send and endless stream of data that will cause the breaking the server. 

  - __```client_body_timeout```__ – max time to receive request body;
  - __```client_header_timeout```__ – max time to receive request headers;
  - __```keepalive_timeout```__ – max time to keep a connection open for;
  - __```send_timeout```__ – max time for the client to accept/receive a response;


  Timeouts, by default, are set in *milliseconds*. But we can specify it in range from seconds even up to years:
   ```nginx
   client_body_timeout 12; // millisecnods
   client_header_timeout12s; // seconds
   keepalive_timeout 12m; // minutes
   send_timeout 12h; // hours
   ...
   ```
   <br/>
   
### Adding Dynamic Modules
In order to add new modules to Nginx we have to re-build it from source, so we'll need the source code (see the [INSTALLATION](#insyallation) section).

**Steps:**
__1.__ Check existing Nginx configuration the current install was built with.
  ```shell
  nginx -V
  ```
__2.__ Copy the configuration.
   ```shell
   --sbin-path=/usr/bin/nginx --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log --with-pcre --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --with-http_ssl_module
   ```
__3.__ Add our new modules to this configuraton.
  - Check the dynamic modules available with downloaded source code
  
    ```shell
    ./configure --help | grep dynamic
    ```
  - Choose module to install from the list. For example, we have chosen __```http_image_filter_module```__. 
  Now we need just copy previous __./configure__ command and add our module to it to get new module compiled into Nginx along with others. Don't forget to add __```--with```__ prefix and __```=dynamic```__ postfix to the modules name, it should look like this: __```--with_http_image_filter_module=dynamic```__.
  We also have to specify the modules path to make Nginx find them much easier:
  __```--modules_path=/etc/nginx/modules```__.
  <br/>
  
  Final command shold look like this:   
    ```shell
    ./configure --sbin-path=/usr/bin/nginx --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log --with-pcre --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --with-http_ssl_module
    --with_http_image_filter_module=dynamic --modules_path=/etc/nginx/modules
    ```
__4.__ Run the command above and then compile and install Nginx.
  ```shell
  make && make install
  ```   
__5.__ Reload Nginx and check its status
   ```shell
   systemctl reload nginx && systemctl status nginx
   ```
__6.__ Now we can use installed module in the confifuration by adding it with __```load_module```__ directive.
  ```nginx
load_module modules/ngx_http_image_filter_module.so;

events {}

http {

  include mime.types;

  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.con;

    root /sites/demo;

    location = /thumb.png {
        image_filter rotate 180;
      }
    }
  }
   ```

<br/>

## PERFORMANCE
### Headers and Expires
Nginx allows us to set headers with __add_header__ directive followed by header name and value.

An __Expires__ http header informs the client how long it can cache its response for. It used for the data that doesn't change often, so the client can skip requesting it form the server every time and use its own cache.
We can set up an __Expires__ header manually with standart __```add_header```__ directive, but Nginx provides a simple and convenient directive __```expires```__. It allows us to use Nginx's duration (in minutes, hours, months, etc.) instead of the full date value that required for that header by HTTP protocol spec.

Following example shows how to set corresponding headers and an cache expiration time for 1 month for all static files in particular path.
  ```nginx
  location ~* \.(css|js|jpg|png)$ {
      access_log off;
      add_header Cache-Control public;
      add_header Pragma public;
      add_header Vary Accept-Encoding;
      expires 1M;
    }
  ```

<br/>

### Compressed Responses with gzip
We can compress server's response data to decrease its size and delivery time.

 - First, we need to enable a __```gzip```__ compression:
    ```nginx
    http {

      gzip on;

      server {
        ...
      }
    }
    ```
    The next directive is __```gzip_comp_level```__. It allows us to set the amount of compression used. A lower number is resulting a larger files but requiring less server resources, and  a higher number is resluting a smaller files but more server resource is required. Note that at levels over 5 the reduction in file size becomes very minor, so typically 3 or 4 is a good option. 
<br/>

- Then we need to specify the file types to apply a compression to. It can be done with __```gzip_types```__ directive. 
  ```nginx
  http {

    gzip on;
    gzip_comp_level 3;

    gzip_types text/css;
    gzip_types text/javascript;

    server {
      
      listen 80;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;

      root /sites/demo;

      location ~* \.(css|js|jpg|png)$ {
        access_log off;
        add_header Cache-Control public;
        add_header Pragma public;
        add_header Vary Accept-Encoding;
        expires 1M;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Important to know that the client should accept conpressed responses by specifing allowed compression types in _"Accept-Encoding"_ request header.

For more on __```gzip```__ module, see the docs: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_module.html

<br/>

### FastCGI Cache

__FastCGI__ is a binary protocol by which Nginx can connect to the dynamic language server (say Django or NodeJS). In that case Nginx is working as a __reversed proxy__. This functionality covered in [Reverse Proxy](#reverse-proxy) secion.

Just like a standart client cache allows browser to keep and load rarely altered resources locally, Nginx's __FastCGI Cache__ or __Micro Cache__ gives us the ability to cache the data that comes from the dynamic language service to the Nginx. It can avoid or at least minmize dynamic langiuage server load and processing.

__1.__ In order to configure Nginx's micro cache, first we need to  specify where cache will be located by using __```fastcgi_cache_path```__ directive with desired path, and following paramers:
 - *keys_zone* - sets the cache name and size 
 - *levels* - sets the levels cache directory
 - *inactive* sets the time to the next cahce update (defult is 10 minutes if ommited).
   
  There are more parameters exist, but these three are key ones.
  
__Example:__  
  ```nginx
  fastcgi_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=ZONE_1:100m inactive=60m;
  ```
<br/>

__2.__ Next we need to specify __```fastcgi_cache_key```__ directive which takes a desired cache structure as an argument. It will help us to identify every cache entry by defined structure. To make every cache entry look like, for example, __https://GETdomain.com/blog/article__, we can use Nginx native variables: 
  ```nginx
  fastcgi_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";
  ```

<br/>

__3.__ Then we have to implement the way we want our dynamic content to be cached for specific locaton. 
    __```fastcgi_cache```__ – specifies the name of cache to use
    __```fastcgi_cache_valid```__ – specifies the response type by http status codes and a time the cache should live for;
    __```fastcgi_cache_bypass```__ – specifies if Nginx should bypass serving form the cache
    __```fastcgi_no_cache```__ – specifies if Nginx should write the response to the cache

<br/>

__4.__ Finally, we can add __```X-Cache```__ header to all the responses to check if the data was served from the cache or not. For this purpose, Nginx has a native variable __```$upstream_cache_status```__.    

  __All together:__
  ```nginx
  user www-data;

  worker_processes auto;

  events {
    worker_connections 1024;
  }

  http {

    include mime.types;

    fastcgi_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=ZONE_1:100m inactive=60m;
    fastcgi_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";
    add_header X-Cache $upstream_cache_status;

    server {

      listen 80;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;

      root /sites/demo;

      index index.html;
  
      set $no_cache 0;

      if ($arg_skipcache = 1) {
        set $no_cache 1;
      }

      location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
      }

      location ~\.php$ {

        include fastcgi.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;

        fastcgi_cache ZONE_1;
        fastcgi_cache_valid 200 60m;
        fastcgi_cache_bypass $no_cache;
        fastcgi_no_cache $no_cache;
      }
    }
  }

  ```

  ### Enabling HTTP 2
  As of version of 1.9.5, Nginx includes new __```http_v2_module```__.
  To enable it we have to add it the same way as any other module by [rebuilding](#adding-dynamic-modules) Nginx with __```--with-http_v2_module```__.
  But before we'll be able to use HTTP 2, we need to configure the SSL (TLS) connection. Make shure __```--with-http_ssl_module```__ is added to the Nginx config during installation and you have your ssl certificates located in known directory.

  __Steps__:
  __1.__ Change Nginx's port from 80 to 443 and add _ssl_ and _http2_ arguments to __```listen```__ directive in the __```server```__ context.

  ```nginx
    server {

      listen 443 ssl http2;
      ...
    }  
  ```  
  __2.__ Specify the path to ssl certificate and key by using __```ssl_certificate```__ and __```ssl_certificate_key```__ directives.
  
  
  ```nginx
    server {

      listen 443 ssl;
      ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/<your_cert_name>.crt
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/<your_ssl_ley_name>.key
      ...
    }  
  ```
<br/>

## SECURITY
### HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

- __Redirect _http_ to _https___
In the [previos](#enabling-http-2) section we have changed a listen port form 80 to 443, so now our server takes requests to 443 but unable to connect if we try to send request via _http_. To fix this, we simply need to redirect all _http_ requests to the equivalent _https_ handlers.
The best way to do that is create the second __```server```__ context that will listed to port 80 on the same domain and redirect clients to port 443 by returning __301__ status code.
  ```nginx
    server {

      listen 80;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;;
      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
      ...
    }
  ```  
  
 - __Improve the SSL encryption__ by using TLS instead of outdated SSL protocol. To achieve this, we have to list supported TLS versions using __```ssl_protocols```__ directive in the __```server```__ context.
  ```nginx
    server {
      ...
      ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
      ...
    ...
    }
  ```  
   
- __Specify cipher suits__ that should be used and not used by the TLS protocol to encrypt our connection.
  ```nginx
    server {
      ...

      ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
      ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+3DES:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5;
      ...
    }
  ```   

- __Enable DH Params__, which stands for __Diffie-Hellman Key Excahge__. It's a complicated topic and you can learn more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) and [here](https://hackernoon.com/algorithms-explained-diffie-hellman-1034210d5100). But for our simple purposes we only need to know that have these parameters enabled allows our server to perform key exchanges with the client with perfect secrecy.

  To make it work, we have first generate the parameters with __```openssl```__ command line tools by providing the size and a location. 
    ```shell
    openssl dhparam 2048 -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem
    ```
    Note that 2048 is the size that (very importantly) shlould match thie size of our private key.
    
    Now we can enable DH Params with __```ssl_dhparam```__ directive;
    ```nginx
      server {
        ...

        ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
        ...
      }
    ```

- __Enable HSTS__ (_HTTP Strict Transport Security_). This is a header that tell the browser not load anything over _http_, so we can minimize redirects from port 80 to port 443.
  ```nginx
    server {
        ...

        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
        ...
      }
  ```
- __Enabel SSL Session Cache__. It allows the server to cache http2 handshakes for a set amount of time to improve the connection.   
  ```nginx
    server {
        ...

        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:40m;
        ssl_session_timeout 4h;
        ssl_session_tickets on;
        ...
      }
  ```

  __All together:__

  ```nginx

  worker_processes auto;

  events {
    worker_connections 1024;
  }

  http {

    include mime.types;

    server {

      listen 80;
      server_name 167.99.93.26;
      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    server {

      listen 443 ssl http2;
      server_name *.mydomain.com;

      root /sites/demo;

      index index.html;

      ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/self.crt;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/self.key;

      ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

      ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
      ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+3DES:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5;

      ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;

      add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;

      ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:40m;
      ssl_session_timeout 4h;
      ssl_session_tickets on;

      location / {
        ...
      }
    }
  }

  ```

  ### Rate Limiting
  Nginx alllows us to manage incoming connections to the server for a specific reason: 
  - __security__ – prevent brute force attacks
  - __reliability__ – prevent traffic spikes
  - __shaping__ – configure service priority

  In order to set a rate limits to our server, we have to specify following parameters:
  <br/>
  

  __1.__  __```limit_req_zone```__ directive in __```http```__ context. 
  Parameters:
  - ___request zone___ – defines the zone requests based on.
 For example: 
    -  __```$server_name```__ variable will apply reate limiting to all reqeusts based on the server name;
    -  __```$binary_remote_addr```__ will apply limiting per user, as each conntcting client will have a unique IP address; 
    -  __```$request_uri```__ will limit connections per request URI, regardless of the client IP address;
  - ___zone name___ (```zone=<ZONE_NAME>:<ZONE_SIZE>```) - defines zone name and the size of the zone in memmory:
  - ___rate___ (```rate=<NUMBER_0F_REQEUST>/<TIME_UNIT>```) - sets the max allowed number of requestst per unit of time.
   
    __NOTE__: 60 requests per minute doesn't mean that the server will wait for 50 seconds to allow incoming traffic again if, say, we received 60 requests in 10 seconds. Nginx apply rate limits evenly, so 60r/m (sixty requests per minute) means the same as 1r/s (one reqeust per second).
    <br/>
    

  __2.__ __```limit_req```__ in the __```server```__ or __```location```__ context. 
  Parameters:
    - ___zone name___ (```zone=<ZONE_NAME>```) – defines the name of the zone to apply limit of.
    - ___burst___ (```burst=<NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS>```) – allows us to set the number or requests that will also be fullfilled after rate limit have been reached. It just extends our default limit. But it's important to understand that __burst__ connections will not be responded immediately, it just won't be rejected and will be fullfilled when possible according to the main rate limit. This parameter can be also specified in the __```limit_req_zone```__ directive to apply to all child contexts. 
    - __nodelay__ - tells Nginx to fullfill burst requests as quickly as possible.
  
    <br/>
    
  __All together__:
    ```nginx
    http {

      ...

      limit_req_zone $request_uri zone=MYZONE:10m rate=60r/m;
      ...

      server {
        ...

        limit_req zone=MYZONE burst=5 nodelay;
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

    <br/>
    
    ### Basic Auth
    Basic Auth provides a simple username and password layer to any part of your site. Before securing our service, we have to generate a password file in __```.htpasswd```__ format (requires to have __apache2-utils__ (APT) or __httpd-tools__ (YUM) installed). 
    <br/>
    
    Run:
    ```shell
    htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd <user_name> 
    ```
    and provide an actual password for specified user.
    <br/>
    

    Now we can apply generated password protection to any desired locaion with following directives:
    <br/>
    

    - __```auth_basic```__  – defines the message to display to the client the.
    - __```auth_basic_user_file```__ - specified password file location 
  
  <br/>
  
  __All together:__
  ```nginx

  location / {

    auth_basic "Secure Area";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    ...
  }
  ```
<br/>

## REVERSE PROXY AND LOAD BALANCING
### Reverse Proxy
Nginx can work as a reverse proxy server meaning that Nginx can be an intermediate layer redirecting client reqeusts to specified processing server and then response from that server will be sent back to the client. 

To redirect client reqestst to desired backend service, we can use __```proxy_pass```__ directive in the __```location```__ contexts.
  ```nginx
  location / {

      proxy_pass <BACKEN_SERVICE_URI>
      ...
    }
  ```
__NOTE__: It is important to keep a trailing slash __```/```__ in your BACKEN_SERVICE_URI to request paths will match ones on your processing server.

__Example__:
  ```nginx
  location / {

      proxy_pass 'https://nginx.org/';
      ...
    }
  ```

  We can also set __custom headers__ on both requests or responses.
  - use __```add_header```__ directive to set and passe custom headers __to the client__.

  ```nginx
    location / {

      ...
      add_header Proxied nginx
      ...
    }
  ```
  - use __```proxy_set_header```__ to set and passe custom headers __to the server__.
  ```nginx
    location / {

      ...
      proxy_set_header Proxied nginx
      ...
    }
  ```
  <br/>
  
  ### Load Balancer
  Load Balancing is a proceess of distributing requests to multiple service instances in order to reduce the load on individual servers and rediriecting requests to only working services if one or more of them are failed for some reason.

  To use Nginx as a load balancer, we have to define an __```upstream```__ context that will include several servers with the ability to add some options. In other words, it is a named collection of servers that serves the same content. It gets defined in the __```http```__ context.

  ```nginx
    http {

      upstream <UPSTREAM_NAME> {
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_1>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_2>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_3>;
        ...
      }
    }
  ```

  Than we need to proxy all requests with __```proxy_pass```__ directive to disired location to created upstream.

  ```nginx
    http {

      upstream <UPSTREAM_NAME> {
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_1>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_2>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_3>;
        ...
      }

      location / {
        proxy_pass <UPSTREAM_NAME>
      }
    }
  ```
  Now all requests to the root path will be directe to specified processing server instances in __Round Robin__ fashion, meaning that every request is proxied to the next working instance.

  <br/>
  
  ### Load Balancing Options

  - __Sticky Sessons__ - the request bounds to client's IP address and alwayd, when possible, proxied to the same server instance. This allows us to maintain user sessions for login state, chats, etc.
  To enable sticky session, add __```ip_hash```__ directive without arguments to __```upstream```__
  ```nginx
    http {

      upstream <UPSTREAM_NAME> {
        ip_hash;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_1>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_2>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_3>;
        ...
      }

      ...
    }
  ```

  - __Distriburing request based on active connections__ – instead of proxying every request to the next instance n qeue, Nginx will direct new request to the instance with a least number of connections.
  To implement this behavior, we need to replace __```ip_hash```__ directive to __```least_conn```__.
  ```nginx
    http {

      upstream <UPSTREAM_NAME> {
        least_conn;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_1>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_2>;
        server <HOST_NAME>:<PORT_3>;
        ...
      }

      ...
    }
  ```

  <br/>
