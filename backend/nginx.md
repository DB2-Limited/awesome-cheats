#### HIGHLY PERFORMANT WEB SERVER

- ## INSTALLATION

###Install with a package manager
Quick and easy but doesn't allow to install any extra modules

#### APT (Debian and Ubuntu)

```css
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
```
After installation with **apt-get**, Nginx starts running automatically.

Check the installation and started process
```css
ps aux | grep nginx
```
Check configuraton files now stored in following directory
```css
ls -l /etc/nginx
```

#### YUM (Fedora and CentOS)
```css
yum install epel-release
yum install nginx
```
After installation with **yum**, Nginx doesn't run automatically. You need to start it as a service with following command.
```css
service nginx start
```

### Install by building from source and adding modules

Go to http://nginx.org/en/download.html, find Mainline version, copy the link and download the archive
```css
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.15.3.tar.gz
```
Extract files from the archive and chage into extracted directory
```css
tar -zxvf nginx-1.15.3.tar.gz 
cd nginx-1.15.3
```
In order to compile our source code we need to install a compiler
**apt**
```css
apt-get install build-essential
```
**yum**
```css
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```
Install additinal required dependecies
**apt**
```css
apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev 
```
**yum**
```css
yum install pcre pcre-devel zlib zlib-devel openssl openssl-devel
```
Configure the source code for the build
```css
./cofigure --sbin-path=/usr/bin/nginx --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log --with-pcre --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --with-http_ssl_module
```
See complete list of options for install modules here: http://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html

Compile configured source code and than install the compiled source
```css
make && make install
```
Test installation by checking Nginx version
```nginx
nginx -V
```
Now you can start Nginx by simply running
```nginx
nginx
```

### Configure a system service for Nginx
This will allow us to start, stop, restart, reload configuration and start Nginx on boot much simplier

Create and save following file as /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
```css
[Unit]
Description=The NGINX HTTP and reverse proxy server
After=syslog.target network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/nginx -t
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nginx
ExecReload=/usr/bin/nginx -s reload
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now you can user **systemctl** to control Nginx
```css
systemctl start nginx //start nginx
systemctl status nginx //check nginx status
systemctl stop nginx //stop nginx
systemctl enable nginx //make nginx always start on boot
```

- ## CONFIGURATION

Two main configuration terms are **context** and **directive**;
- **Directives** are specific configurations options that get set in the configuration files and consist of __name__ and a __value__.
- **Context**, on the other hand, is a sections of a configuration where directives can be set for that given context. Essentially __context__ is the same as scope. And like scope, context are also nestted and inherit from their parents.

The main configuration file is /etc/nginx/__nginx.conf__
It may include configuration pieces from other .conf files by __include__ \<file relative path> directive. 

Basic example
```css

events {}

http {

  include mime.types;

  server {

    listen 80; 
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;
  }
}

```

After altering the .conf file, you need to reload the server to changes take effect. To do it without downtime, use:
```css
systemctl reload nginx
```

If your configuration is not workin as expected, verify the syntax by running:
```css
nginx -t
```

### Location Blocks
Location blocks define the server behavior on reqeusts to the specific URIs (or routes) relative to the root directory.
```css
location = <URI> {
    /...handle response
}
```

There are four types of URI match patterns
__1. Exact match__
   ```css
   =
   ```
   Example
   ```css
   location = /greet {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location.';
    }
   ```
__2. Preferential prefix match__
   ```css
   ^~
   ```
   Example
   ```css
   location ^~ /Greet2 {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location.';
    }
   ```
__3. Case sensitive REGEX match__
   ```css
   ~
   ```      
   Example
   ```css
    location ~ /greet[0-9] {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - REGEX MATCH.';
    }
   ```
__4. Case insensitive REGEX match__ (same priority as case sensitive REGEX match)
   ```css
    *~
   ```
   Example
   ```css
   location ~* /greet[0-9] {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - REGEX MATCH INSENSITIVE.';
    }
   ```
__5. Prerfix match__ 
```css
// no modifier, just URI
```
Example
```css
location /greet {
    return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - PREFIX MATCH.';
}
```

__nginx.conf__
```css

http {

  include mime.types;

  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    // Preferential Prefix match
    location ^~ /Greet2 {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location.';
    }

    // REGEX match - case insensitive
    location ~* /greet[0-9] {
      return 200 'Hello from NGINX "/greet" location - REGEX MATCH INSENSITIVE.';
    }
  }
}
```
### Variables

Nginx provodes a set of useful native variables. They all prefixed with a __$__ sign.
```css
$host
$uri
$args
```

Usage example: the response of /inspect route will be a requested host, uri and arguments provided in the request query string
```css
location /inspect {
    return 200 "$host\n $uri\n $args";
}
```
If our query string has two parameters __fname__ and __lname__, we can get its values individually:
```css
location /inspect {
    return 200 "First Name: $arg_fname\n Last Name: $arg_lname";
}
```
See the full list of Nginx native variables here: http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html

We can create our own variables with a special __set__ directive followed by variable name and its value (can be a string, an integer or boolean.
```css
set $admin "Yes";
```
After the declaration we can use our new variable in the context it has been declared in and all child contexts.

### Conditional Statemets
Nginx config syntax supports basic conditional statements with __if__ directive.

```css
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    set $mon 'No';

    if ( $date_local = 'Monday' ) {
      set $mon 'Yes';
    }

    location /is_monday {

      return 200 $mon;
    }
  }
```
We can alse use regular expressions in conditional statements with __~__ operator:
```css
if ( $date_local ~ 'Saturday|Sunday' ) {
      set $weekend 'Yes';
    }
```
Note that using conditional statemets inside the location blocks is higly discouraged, it can cause unexpected behavior. See the article: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/depth/ifisevil

### Rewrites & Redirects

We can rewrite reqeusted URI and direct the client to another URI by using __rewrite__ or __return__ directives. In case of using __return__ with the 3** status codes, instead of string as a second parameters, it accepts an URI which the client should be redirected to. Syntax:
```css
return 3** <URI>
rewrite <regex pattern> <URI>
```
Example with __return__
```css
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    location /greet {
      return 307 /thumb.png;
    }
  }
```
Exaple with __rewrite__
```css
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    rewrite ^/user/\w+ /greet

    location /greet {
      return 200 "Hello User!";
    }
  }
```
Note that in case of using __return__, the URI of your reqeust will be changed to one you have been redirected to. If you use __rewrite__ directive, your URI will remain the same and you will get the content of redirection destination page.

We can also use regular expression to capture and use individual parts of the request URI with __$__ sign. In the exapmle above, we captured provided parameter to redirect the client to the specified location:
```css
  server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    rewrite ^/user/(\w+) /greet/$1

    location /greet {
      return 200 "Hello User!";
    }

    location = /greet/john {
       return 200 "Hello John!" 
    }
  }
```

Another useful feature is using the __last__ flag to not allow the URI to be rewritten after the first rewrite. In the exapmlw below, the first rewrite statement will trigger the redirection to ***/greet/john***, but will not be rewritten by the second statement, so ***"Hello John"*** will be returned instead of ***/thumb.png***.

```css
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name *.mydomain.com;

    root /sites/demo;

    rewrite ^/user/(\w+) /greet/$1 last;
    rewrite ^/greet/john /thumb.png;

    location /greet {

      return 200 "Hello User";
    }

    location = /greet/john {
      return 200 "Hello John";
    }
  }
```
