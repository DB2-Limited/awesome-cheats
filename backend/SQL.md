#### COMMONLY USED QUERIES

- ## QUERYING DATA FROM A TABLE

***Query data in columns c1, c2 from a table***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t;
```
***Query all rows and columns from a table***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE condition
```
***Query distinct rows from a table***
```
SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t 
WHERE condition;
```
***Sort the result set in ascending or descending order***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
ORDER BY c1 ASC [DESC];
```
***Skip offset of rows and return the next n rows***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
ORDER BY c1
LIMIT n OFFSET offset;
```
***Group rows using an aggregate function***
```
SELECT c1, aggregate(c2)
FROM t
GROUP BY c1;
```
***Filter groups using HAVING clause***
```
SELECT c1, aggregate(c2) FROM t
GROUP BY c1
HAVING condition;
```


- ## QUERYING FROM MULTIPLE TABLES

<p align="left">
  <img src="./assets/sql/inner-join.png" width="250">
</p>

***Inner join t1 and t2***: Select all records from t1 and t2, where the join condition is met.
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

<p align="left">
  <img src="./assets/sql/left-join.png" width="250">
</p>

***Left join t1 and t2***: Select all records from t1, along with records from t2 for which the join condition is met (if at all)
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1
LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition;
```
<p align="left">
  <img src="./assets/sql/right-join.png" width="250">
</p>

***Right join t1 and t2***: Select all records from t2, along with records from t1 for which the join condition is met (if at all).
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1
RIGHT JOIN t2 ON condition;
```
<p align="left">
  <img src="./assets/sql/full-join.png" width="250">
</p>

***Perform full join***: Select all records from t1 and t2, regardless of whether the join condition is met or not.
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1
FULL JOIN t2 ON condition;
```
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1
CROSS JOIN t2;
```
***Another way to perform cross join***
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1, t2;
```
***Join t1 to itself using INNER JOIN clause***
```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1 A
INNER JOIN t2 B ON condition;
```


- ## USING SQL OPERATORS
***Combine rows from two queries***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 
UNION [ALL]
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2; 
```
***Return the intersection of two queries***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
INTERSECT
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```
***Subtract a result set from another result set***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
MINUS
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```
***Query rows using pattern matching %, _***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
WHERE c1 [NOT] LIKE pattern;
```
***Query rows in a list***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE c1 [NOT] IN value_list; 
```
***Query rows between two values***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE c1 BETWEEN low AND high; 
```
***Check if values in a table is NULL or not***
```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE c1 IS [NOT] NULL;
```

- ## MANAGING TABLES

***Create a new table with three columns***
```
CREATE TABLE t (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR NOT NULL, price INT DEFAULT 0
);
```
***Delete the table from the database***
```
DROP TABLE t ;
```
***Add a new column to the table***
```
ALTER TABLE t ADD column; 
```
***Drop column c from the table***
```
ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c ; 
```
***Add a constraint***
```
ALTER TABLE t ADD constraint; 
```
***Drop a constraint***
```
ALTER TABLE t DROP constraint; 
```
***Rename a table from t1 to t2***
```
ALTER TABLE r1 RENAME TO t2;
```
***Rename column c1 to c2***
```
ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME c1 TO c2 ; 
```
***Remove all data in a table***
```
TRUNCATE TABLE t; 
```

- ## USING SQL CONSTRAINTS

***Set c1 and c2 as a primary key***
```
CREATE TABLE t(
  c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 VARCHAR,
  PRIMARY KEY (c1,c2) 
);
```
***Set c2 column as a foreign key***
```
CREATE TABLE t1(
  c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
  c2 INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (c2) REFERENCES t2(c2)
);
```
***Make the values in c1 and c2 unique***
```
CREATE TABLE t( 
  c1 INT, c1 INT,
  UNIQUE(c2,c3) 
);
```
***Ensure c1 > 0 and values in c1 >= c2***
```
CREATE TABLE t(
  c1 INT, c2 INT,
  CHECK(c1> 0 AND c1 >= c2)
);
```
***Set values in c2 column not NULL***
```
CREATE TABLE t(
  c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
  c2 VARCHAR NOT NULL 
);
```

- ##  MODIFYING DATA

***Insert one row into a table***
```
INSERT INTO t(column_list)

```
***Insert rows from t2 into t1***

FROM t2;
```
***Update new value in the column c1 for all rows***
```
UPDATE t
SET c1 = new_value;
```
***Update values in the column c1, c2 that match the condition***
```
UPDATE t
SET c1 = new_value,
    c2 = new_value 
WHERE condition;
```
***Delete all data in a table***
```
DELETE FROM t; 
```
***Delete subset of rows in a table***
```
DELETE FROM t
WHERE condition;
```

- ## MANAGING VIEWS

```
***Create a new view with check option***
```
CREATE VIEW v(c1,c2) AS
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t;
WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION; 
```
***Create a recursive view***
```
CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW v
AS
select-statement // anchor part 
UNION [ALL]
select-statement; // recursive part 
```
***Create a temporary view***
```
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW v AS
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t;
```
***Delete a view***
```
DROP VIEW view_name 
```

- ## MANAGING INDEXES

***Create an index on c1 and c2 of the table t***
```
CREATE INDEX idx_name
ON t(c1,c2);
```
***Create a unique index on c3, c4 of the table t***
```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_name
ON t(c3,c4);
```
***Drop an index***
```
DROP INDEX idx_name; 
```

- ### SQL AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
```
AVG   // returns the average of a list
COUNT // returns the number of elements of a list
