# REST API URL Patterns

## Resource model
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/rest_api_design_patterns/uri_path_design.png" width="300">
</p>

**Document** - resource, object or instance, database record.
```
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players/mike
```
**Collection** - server-managed directory of resources.
```
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players
```
**Store** - client-managed resource repository. A store resource lets an API client put
resources in, get them back out, and decide when to delete them. On their own, stores
do not create new resources; therefore a store never generates new URIs. Instead, each
stored resource has a URI that was chosen by a client when it was initially put into the
store.
```
PUT /users/1234/favorites/alonso
```
**Controller** - procedural concept, executable functions, with parameters and return values; inputs and outputs.
```
POST /alerts/245743/resend
```

#### Rules relating to the design of meaningful URI paths
1. A singular noun should be used for document names
```
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players/claudio
```

2. A plural noun should be used for collection names
```
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players
```

3. A plural noun should be used for store names
```
http://api.music.restapi.org/artists/mikemassedotcom/playlists
```

4. A verb or verb phrase should be used for controller names
```
http://api.college.restapi.org/students/morgan/register
http://api.example.restapi.org/lists/4324/dedupe
http://api.ognom.restapi.org/dbs/reindex
http://api.build.restapi.org/qa/nightly/runTestSuite
```

5. Variable path segments may be substituted with identity-based
values
```
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/{leagueId}/teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}
http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players/21
```

6. CRUD function names should not be used in URIs
```
DELETE /users/1234
```
instead of:
```
GET /deleteUser?id=1234
GET /deleteUser/1234
DELETE /deleteUser/1234
POST /users/1234/delete
```

## URI structure
RFC 3986 defines the generic URI syntax as shown below:
```
URI = scheme "://" authority "/" path [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
```

#### Rules to URI Query Design
1. The query component of a URI may be used to filter collections or stores
```
GET /users
GET /users?role=admin
```

2. The query component of a URI should be used to paginate collection
or store results  
A REST API client should use the query component to paginate collection and store
results with the **pageSize** and **pageStartIndex** parameters. The **pageSize** parameter
specifies the maximum number of contained elements to return in the response. The
**pageStartIndex** parameter specifies the zero-based index of the first element to return
in the response
```
GET /users?pageSize=25&pageStartIndex=50
```

## Identifier Design with URIs

#### Rules to URI format
1. Forward slash separator `/` must be used to indicate a hierarchical
relationship
`http://api.canvas.restapi.org/shapes/polygons/quadrilaterals/squares`

2. A trailing forward slash `/` should not be included in URIs
`http://api.canvas.restapi.org/shapes/polygons/quadrilaterals/squares` instead of:
`http://api.canvas.restapi.org/shapes/polygons/quadrilaterals/squares/`

3. Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs
`http://api.example.restapi.org/blogs/mark-masse/entries/this-is-my-first-post`

4. Underscores `_` should not be used in URIs

5. Uppercase letters should not be used in URIs
`http://api.example.restapi.org/my-folder/my-doc`

6. File extensions should not be included in URIs
`http://api.college.restapi.org/students/3248234/transcripts/2005/fall`
instead of
`http://api.college.restapi.org/students/3248234/transcripts/2005/fall.json`

## Interaction Design with HTTP

#### Rules about using HTTP methods
1. GET and POST must not be used to tunnel other request methods
2. GET must be used to retrieve a representation of a resource
3. HEAD should be used to retrieve response headers
4. PUT must be used to both insert and update a stored resource
5. PUT must be used to update mutable resources
6. POST must be used to create a new resource in a collection
7. POST must be used to execute controllers
8. DELETE must be used to remove a resource from its parent
9. OPTIONS should be used to retrieve metadata that describes a
resource’s available interactions


#### Status codes categories
|Category|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|1xx: Informational | Communicates transfer protocol-level information |
|2xx: Success | Indicates that the client request was accepted successfully |
|3xx: Redirection | Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request |
|4xx: Client Error | This category of error status codes points the finger at clients |
|5xx: Server Error | The server takes responsibility for these error status codes |


#### Rules about using status codes
1. `200 (“OK”)` should be used to indicate nonspecific success
2. `200 (“OK”)` must not be used to communicate errors in the response
body
3. `201 (“Created”)` must be used to indicate successful resource creation
4. `202 (“Accepted”)` must be used to indicate successful start of an
asynchronous action
5. `204 (“No Content”)` should be used when the response body is
intentionally empty
6. `301 (“Moved Permanently”)` should be used to relocate resources
7. `302 (“Found”)` should not be used
8. `303 (“See Other”)` should be used to refer the client to a different URI
9. `304 (“Not Modified”)` should be used to preserve bandwidth
10. `307 (“Temporary Redirect”)` should be used to tell clients to resubmit
the request to another URI
11. `400 (“Bad Request”)` may be used to indicate nonspecific failure
12. `401 (“Unauthorized”)` must be used when there is a problem with the
client’s credentials
13. `403 (“Forbidden”)` should be used to forbid access regardless of
authorization state
14. `404 (“Not Found”)` must be used when a client’s URI cannot be mapped
to a resource
15. `405 (“Method Not Allowed”)` must be used when the HTTP method is
not supported
16. `406 (“Not Acceptable”)` must be used when the requested media type
cannot be served
17. 409 (“Conflict”)` should be used to indicate a violation of resource state
18. `412 (“Precondition Failed”)` should be used to support conditional
operations
19. `415 (“Unsupported Media Type”)` must be used when the media type
of a request’s payload cannot be processed
20. `500 (“Internal Server Error”)` should be used to indicate API
malfunction
