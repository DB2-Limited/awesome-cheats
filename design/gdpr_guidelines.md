# GDPR guidelines

## You should not request more information than you require
You must ask a person to complete the minimum information sufficient to perform a task. For example, if you do not need to know a person’s date of birth, do not add it to the form.

</p>


## Checkboxes
All checkboxes should be disabled by default. Non-required fields must have explanations as to why you require that information.

</p>

## Only relevant information should be collected from individuals
For example, an insurance company needs to compile a lot of information, so asking for a person’s address is acceptable. Also, your form must clearly state why your company needs to collect this data.

</p>

## Information or requests should only be asked at the relevant page or field
For example, you should only ask a user for access to their camera when they are on the appropriate page, i.e. the camera app, not when they are are accessing a library or music app.

</p>

## Unnecessary permission
If your app only needs to use geolocation, then you should not ask an individual for contact or camera access. Another example is a music application asking permission to access your contact list. Also, the company has not explained why the app needs this information.

</p>

## Non-obvious access
If there is a reason your company requires access, that is not immediately apparent to a customer; you need to explain this in the text. Then, for example, the user has a clear understanding as to why they need to give access to their contact list.

</p>

## All checkboxes shouldn't be enabled automatically
The user needs to have the option to opt-in to a promotion, for example. Also, what they are choosing, needs to be clearly explained.

</p>

## A user can delete their information from the system
Inside the user profile, there must be the option for them to remove their data from the system entirely.

</p>

## Suspending a user account
By suspending their account, a user makes their data inaccessible to the system. The data is removed from system visibility until the user clicks the "unarchive" link.

</p>

## The username and first and last name are automatically invisible
This information should be hidden by default. If the user wishes their data to be visible to others, they need to click on a checkbox to authorize it.

</p>

## Information collection
All information that you collect from a user needs to be accessible in the user profile. The reason for giving permission needs to be clearly described beneath the checkboxes, and the user needs to have the option to remove their authorization at any point in the future.

</p>

## Make the registration process simple
For example, if a user lives in Los Angeles, he shouldn’t need to enter this information. The system should generate the user’s position automatically and then ask them to approve it, if correct, or allow them to change their location if necessary.

</p>

## Export personal data
The system should make it possible for users to export their data easily.

</p>

## Cookies popup
The cookie popup needs to clearly explain what they are, how the system uses them, and why the user is being asked to grant permissions for their use.

</p>

## The use of cookies in the admin zone
The user must be able to change access to the cookies and change the cookies, at any time.
